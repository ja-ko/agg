# AGG gametype

This is a rewrite of the warsow gametype agungame. It's currently unstable and not recommended to be used. In fact it probably will not even compile.
It's currently being migrated over to warfork. 

For now the gametype requires additional AS-Functions provided by the gameserver. The server mod providing these functions is included as submodule.
